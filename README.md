# WebGL Art Gallery

Welcome to our WebGL-based Art Gallery! This project leverages the power of Lexica RESTful APIs to populate an immersive gallery environment with art pieces based on keywords that the user searches for. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Art Gallery**: Utilizes Lexica's APIs to dynamically populate the gallery with artworks based on the user's search keywords.
- **NPC Gallery Environment**: Experience the gallery in a more immersive and interactive way with Non-Player Characters populating the environment.
- **Custom Character Creation**: The ability for users to add their own custom characters made using [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/).
- **Asset Bundles**: Leverages Unity's Asset Bundles for efficient on-demand content loading and updates.
